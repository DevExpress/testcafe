    Thank you for submitting this issue. Since you are using an outdated version of TestCafe, we recommend you update TestCafe to the [latest version](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/releases/latest) to check if this issue has been addressed. We constantly improve our tools, and there is a chance that this issue has been already resolved and/or is no longer reproducible in the latest version. We look forward to your response.

    Thank you for submitting this issue. We would love to assist you and diagnose it. However, we need a simple sample that we can easily run on our side in order to replicate the issue and research its cause. Without a sample, we are not able to figure out what's going on and why this issue occurs. Refer to this article to create the best example: [How To: Create a Minimal Working Example When You Submit an Issue](https://testcafe.io/402636/faq#how-to-create-a-minimal-working-example-when-you-submit-an-issue). We look forward to your response.

    Thank you for submitting this issue. We would love to assist you and diagnose this issue. However, since your website sits behind a proxy and/or requires authentication, I will not be able to access it. Our policy prevents us from accessing a customer's internal resources without prior written approval from the entity that owns the server/web resource.
    
    If you want us to research the problem further, we'll need access to the server/web resource. Please ask the website owner to send us ([support@devexpress.com](mailto:support@devexpress.com)) written confirmation. It must permit DevExpress personnel to remotely access the website and its internal resources for research/testing and debugging purposes.

    Thank you for submitting this issue. However, the information you shared is insufficient to determine its cause. Please submit a new issue and fill the issue template completely - specify your TestCafe version and share a sample application with a test case that we can run on our side to reproduce and research the issue.

    Any personal estimate may be misleading, so we cannot currently tell it at the moment. Once we get any results, we will post them in this thread.
