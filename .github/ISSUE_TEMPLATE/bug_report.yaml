        If you have all reproduction steps with a complete sample app, please share as many details as possible in the sections below.

        Make sure that you tried using the latest [TestCafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/releases) version, where this behavior might have been already addressed.

        If your tests run in Chromium-based browsers, check if the [Native Automation Mode](https://testcafe.io/documentation/404237/guides/intermediate-guides/native-automation-mode) resolves the issue.

        Before submitting an issue, please check existing issues in [this repository](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues) in case a similar issue exists or was already addressed. This may save your time (and ours).
