        // NOTE: The problem is reproduced only for the following unstable scenario:
        // - 'ExecuteSelectorCommand' is queried on the child page.
        // - the child page is closed. At that moment, the result of the 'ExecuteSelectorCommand' was not sent to the server.
        // - the parent page became a 'master' page and starts processing commands.
        // - the initial command processing request on the new 'master' is interpreted as the 'ExecuteSelectorCommand'.
        // This causes the crash down in the 'replicator' module.
        // To create a stable reproducible example I am forced to guarantee that the result of the 'ExecuteSelectorCommand' isn't sent to the server.
