# TestCafe v0.12.0 Released

HTTP authentication support, a CI-friendly way to start and stop the tested app and lots of API enhancements.

<!--more-->

## Enhancements

### ⚙ HTTP authentication support ([#955](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/955), [#1109](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1109))

TestCafe now supports testing webpages protected with HTTP Basic and NTLM authentication.

Use the [httpAuth](../documentation/guides/advanced-guides/authentication.md#http-authentication) function in fixture or test declaration to specify the credentials.

```js
fixture `My fixture`
    .page `http://example.com`
    .httpAuth({
        username: 'username',
        password: 'Pa$$word',

        // Optional parameters, can be required for the NTLM authentication.
        domain:      'CORP-DOMAIN',
        workstation: 'machine-win10'
    });

test('Test1', async t => {});          // Logs in as username

test                                   // Logs in as differentUserName
    .httpAuth({
        username: 'differentUserName',
        password: 'differentPa$$word'
    })
    ('Test2', async t => {});
```

### ⚙ Built-in CI-friendly way to start and stop the tested web app ([#1047](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1047))

When launching tests, you can now specify a command that starts the tested application.
TestCafe will automatically execute this command before running tests and stop the process when tests are finished.

```sh
testcafe chrome tests/ --app "node server.js"
```

```js
runner
    .startApp('node server.js')
    .run();
```

You can also specify how long TestCafe should wait until the tested application initializes (the default is 1 sec).

```sh
testcafe chrome tests/ --app "node server.js" --app-init-delay 4000
```

```js
runner
    .startApp('node server.js', 4000)
    .run();
```

### ⚙ Screenshot and window resize actions now work on Linux ([#1117](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1117))

The `t.takeScreenshot`, `t.resizeWindow`, `t.resizeWindowToFitDevice` and `t.maximizeWindow` actions can now be executed on Linux machines.

### ⚙ Adding custom properties to the element state ([#749](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/749))

The state of webpage elements can now be extended with custom properties.

We have added the [addCustomDOMProperties](../documentation/reference/test-api/selector/addcustomdomproperties.md)
method to the selector, so that you can add properties to the element state like in the following example.

```js
import { Selector } from 'testcafe'

fixture `My fixture`
    .page `https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/example/`;

test('Check Label HTML', async t => {
    const label = Selector('label').addCustomDOMProperties({
        innerHTML: el => el.innerHTML
    });

    await t.expect(label.innerHTML).contains('input type="checkbox" name="remote"');
});
```

### ⚙ Skipping tests ([#246](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/246))

TestCafe now allows you to specify that a particular test or fixture should be skipped when running tests.
Use the `fixture.skip` and `test.skip` methods for this.

```js
fixture.skip `Fixture1`; // All tests in this fixture will be skipped

test('Fixture1Test1', () => {});
test('Fixture1Test2', () => {});

fixture `Fixture2`;

test('Fixture2Test1', () => {});
test.skip('Fixture2Test2', () => {}); // This test will be skipped
test('Fixture2Test3', () => {});
```

You can also use the `only` method to specify that only a particular test or fixture should run while all others should be skipped.

```js
fixture.only `Fixture1`;
test('Fixture1Test1', () => {});
test('Fixture1Test2', () => {});

fixture `Fixture2`;
test('Fixture2Test1', () => {});
test.only('Fixture2Test2', () => {});
test('Fixture2Test3', () => {});

// Only tests in Fixture1 and the Fixture2Test2 test will run
```

### ⚙ Specifying the start webpage for a test ([#501](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/501))

An individual test can now override the fixture's `page` setting and start on a different page.

 ```js
 fixture `MyFixture`
     .page `http://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/example`;

 test('Test1', async t => {
     // Starts at http://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/example
 });

 test
     .page `http://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/blog/`
     ('Test2', async t => {
         // Starts at http://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/blog/
     });
 ```

### ⚙ Initialization and finalization methods for a test ([#1108](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1108))

We have added the [before](../documentation/reference/test-api/test/before.md)
and [after](../documentation/reference/test-api/test/after.md) methods to the test declaration.
Use them to provide code that will be executed before a test is started and after it is finished.

```js
test
    .before( async t => {
        /* test initialization code */
    })
    ('My Test', async t => {
        /* test code */
    })
    .after( async t => {
        /* test finalization code */
    });
```

### ⚙ Sharing variables between hooks and test code ([#841](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/841))

You can now share variables between `fixture.beforeEach`, `fixture.afterEach`, `test.before`, `test.after` functions and test code
by using the *test context* object.

Test context is available through the `t.ctx` property.

Instead of using a global variable, assign the object you want to share directly to `t.ctx` or create a property like in the following example.

```js
fixture `Fixture1`
    .beforeEach(async t  => {
          t.ctx.someProp = 123;
     });

test
    ('Test1', async t => {
        console.log(t.ctx.someProp); // > 123
    })
    .after(async t => {
         console.log(t.ctx.someProp); // > 123
    });
```

### ⚙ Assertion methods to check for regexp match ([#1038](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1038))

We have added `match` and `notMatch` methods to check if a string matches a particular regular expression.

```js
await t.expect('foobar').match(/^f/, 'this assertion passes');
```

```js
await t.expect('foobar').notMatch(/^b/, 'this assertion passes');
```

### ⚙ Improved filtering by predicates in selectors ([#1025](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1025) and [#1065](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1065))

Selector's filter predicates now receive more information about the current node, which enables you to implement more advanced filtering logic.

The `filter`, `find`, `parent`, `child` and `sibling` methods now pass the node's index to the predicate.
The `find`, `parent`, `child` and `sibling` methods now also pass a node from the preceding selector.

```js
Selector('ul').find((node, idx, originNode) => {
    // node === the <ul>'s descendant node
    // idx === index of the current <ul>'s descendant node
    // originNode === the <ul> element
});
```

In addition, all these methods now allow you to pass objects to the predicate's scope on the client. To this end, we have added
an optional `dependencies` parameter.

```js
const isNodeOk = ClientFunction(node => { /*...*/ });
const flag = getFlag();

Selector('ul').child(node => {
    return isNodeOk(node) && flag;
}, { isNodeOk, flag });
```

### ⚙ Filtering by negative index in selectors ([#738](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/738))

You can now pass negative `index` values to selector methods. In this instance, index is counted from the end of the matched set.

```js
const lastChild = Selector('.someClass').child(-1);
```

### ⚙ Improved cursor positioning in test actions ([#981](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/981))

In action options, X and Y offsets that define the point where action is performed can now be negative.
In this instance, the cursor position is calculated from the bottom-right corner of the target element.

```js
await t.click('#element', { offsetX: -10, offsetY: -30 });
```

### ⚙ Client functions as an assertion's actual value ([#1009](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1009))

You can now pass client functions to assertion's `expect` method. In this instance, the
[Smart Assertion Query Mechanism](../documentation/guides/basic-guides/assert.md#smart-assertion-query-mechanism)
will run this client function and use the return value as the assertion's actual value.

```js
import { ClientFunction } from 'testcafe';

const windowLocation = ClientFunction(() => window.location.toString());

fixture `My Fixture`
    .page `http://www.example.com`;

test('My Test', async t => {
    await t.expect(windowLocation()).eql('http://www.example.com');
});
```

### ⚙ Automatic waiting for scripts added during a test action ([#1072](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1072))

If a test action adds scripts on a page, TestCafe now automatically waits for them to finish before proceeding to the next test action.

### ⚙ New ESLint plugin ([#1083](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1083))

We have prepared an [ESLint plugin](https://github.com/miherlosev/eslint-plugin-testcafe).
Get it to ensure that ESLint does not fail on TestCafe test code.
