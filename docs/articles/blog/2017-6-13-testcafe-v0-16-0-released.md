# TestCafe v0.16.0 Released

TypeScript support, seamless testing in headless Chrome and device emulator, and numerous bug fixes.

<!--more-->

## Enhancements

### ⚙ TypeScript support ([#408](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/408))

In this release, we have added the capability to write tests in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). By using TypeScript to write your TestCafe tests, you get the advantages of strongly-typed languages such as: rich coding assistance, painless scalability, check-as-you-type code verification, and much more.

TestCafe bundles TypeScript declaration file with the npm package, so you have no need to install any additional packages.

Just create a `.ts` file with the

<!-- Use `js` instead of `ts` for this code block for proper code highlighting -->

```js
import { Selector } from 'testcafe';
```

and write your test.

For details, see [TypeScript Support](../documentation/guides/concepts/typescript-and-coffeescript.md)

### ⚙ Support running in Chrome in headless mode and in device emulator ([#1417](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1417))

Now TestCafe allows you to run your tests in Google Chrome in headless and device emulation modes.

[Headless mode](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) allows you to run tests in Chrome without any visible UI shell. To run tests in headless mode, use the `:headless` postfix:

```sh
testcafe "chrome:headless" tests/sample-fixture.js
```

Device emulation mode allows you to check how your tests works on mobile devices via Chrome's built-in [device emulator](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/). To run tests in device emulation mode, specify `emulation:` and [device parameters](../documentation/guides/concepts/browsers.md#emulator-parameters):

```sh
testcafe "chrome:emulation:device=iphone 6" tests/sample-fixture.js
```

For details, see [Using Chrome-specific Features](../documentation/guides/concepts/browsers.md#use-chromium-device-emulation).

### ⚙ Support HTML5 Drag and Drop ([#897](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/897))

Starting with this release, TestCafe supports HTML5 drag and drop, so you can test elements with the `draggable` [attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dnd.html#the-draggable-attribute).

### ⚙ Fixed URL for opening remote browsers ([#1476](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1476))

We have simplified the format of links that TestCafe generates when you [run tests on remote browsers](../documentation/guides/concepts/browsers.md#browsers-on-remote-devices).

Now, you have no need to type a unique link for each test run, all the links became constant. So, it is easier now to run tests on a remote device repeatedly: you can run them by navigating a link from your browser history.

## Bug Fixes

* No TestCafe UI on screenshots created during testing ([#1357](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1357))
* `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events are not triggered during cursor moving ([#1426](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1426))
* The runner's speed option affects the speed of `doubleClick` action ([#1486](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1486))
* Press action shortcuts work wrong if input's value ends with '.' or starts with '-.' ([#1499](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1499))
* A test report has too small line length on Travis ([#1469](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1469))
* Service messages with cookies do not have enough time to come to server before a new page is loaded ([testcafe-hammerhead/#1086](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead/issues/1086))
* The `window.history.replaceState` function is overridden incorrectly ([testcafe-hammerhead/#1146](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead/issues/1146))
* Hammerhead crashes if a script file contains a sourcemap comment ([testcafe-hammerhead/#1052](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead/issues/1052))
* The proxy should override the `DOMParser.parseFromString` method ([testcafe-hammerhead/#1133](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead/issues/1133))
* The `fetch` method should emulate the native behaviour on merging headers ([testcafe-hammerhead/#1116](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead/issues/1116))
* The `EventSource` requests are broken when used via proxy ([testcafe-hammerhead/#1106](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead/issues/1106))
* The code processing may cause syntax errors in some cases because of wrong `location` property wrapping ([testcafe-hammerhead/#1101](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead/issues/1101))
* When calling the `fetch` function without parameters, we should return its native result instead of `window.Promise.reject` ([testcafe-hammerhead/#1099](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead/issues/1099))
* The `querySelector` function is overridden incorrectly ([testcafe-hammerhead/#1131](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead/issues/1131))
