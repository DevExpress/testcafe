# TestCafe v0.23.0 Released

Stop a test run after the first test fail, view JavaScript errors' stack trace in test run reports and let TestCafe restart browsers when they stop responding.

<!--more-->

## Enhancements

### ⚙ Stop Test Run After the First Test Fail ([#1323](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1323))

You can now configure TestCafe to stop the entire test run after the first test fail. This saves your time when you fix problems with your tests one by one.

Specify the [--sf](../documentation/reference/command-line-interface.md#--sf---stop-on-first-fail) flag to enable this feature when you run tests from the command line.

```sh
testcafe chrome my-tests --sf
```

In the API, use the [stopOnFirstFail](../documentation/reference/testcafe-api/runner/run.md) option.

```js
runner.run({ stopOnFirstFail: true })
```

### ⚙ View the JavaScript Errors' Stack Traces in Reports ([#2043](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/2043))

Now when a JavaScript error occurs on the tested webpage, the test run report includes a stack trace for this error (only if the [--skip-js-errors](../documentation/reference/command-line-interface.md#-e---skip-js-errors) option is disabled).

### ⚙ Browsers are Automatically Restarted When They Stop Responding ([#1815](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1815))

If a browser stops responding while it executes tests, TestCafe restarts the browser and reruns the current test in a new browser instance.
If the same problem occurs with this test two more times, the test run finishes and an error is thrown.
