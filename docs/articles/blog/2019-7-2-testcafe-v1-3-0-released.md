# TestCafe v1.3.0 Released

This release introduces support for the custom TypeScript configuration file and includes numerous bugfixes.

<!--more-->

## Enhancements

### âš™ Customize TypeScript Compiler Options ([#1845](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/issues/1845))

> **Update:** v1.3.1 disables automatic detection of the `tsconfig.json` file. See [v1.3.1 release notes](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/blog/testcafe-v1-3-1-released.html) for more information.

TestCafe now allows you to specify the [TypeScript compiler options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) in the `tsconfig.json` configuration file. You can use these options to enable JSX compilation, import code or typings with `paths` aliases, set aliases to React typings, or customize other compiler settings.

Define the `compilerOptions` property in `tsconfig.json` and specify the compiler options in this property:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "jsx": "react",
        "jsxFactory": "myFactory",
        "alwaysStrict": true
    }
}
```

Save this file to the directory from which you run tests (or use the [tsConfigPath](../documentation/reference/configuration-file.md#tsconfigpath) setting in the main configuration file to specify a different location).

See [Customize Compiler Options](../documentation/guides/concepts/typescript-and-coffeescript.md#customize-compiler-options) for more information.
