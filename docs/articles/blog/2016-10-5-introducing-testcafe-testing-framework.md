# Introducing TestCafe Testing Framework

We are happy to announce that today DevExpress releases the core of its TestCafe automated browser testing
tool as an open-source framework for node.js.

<!--more-->

When it comes to functional testing against real browsers,
node.js developers currently have no other option than using non-native solutions.
These tools usually come with browser plugins and require alien runtimes
like Java - things you need to manually install, configure and maintain
in every testing environment.

TestCafe is pure node.js and it does not require browser plugins
to run tests. Being an all-in-one solution, it covers all testing stages:
starting browsers, running tests, gathering test results and generating reports.
