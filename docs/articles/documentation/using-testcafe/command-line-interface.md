# Command Line Interface

```sh
testcafe [options] <browser-list-comma-separated> <file-or-glob ...>
```

## Browser List

The `browser-list-comma-separated` argument specifies the list of browsers (separated by commas) where tests will be ran.

### Local Browsers

You can specify local browsers by using paths or [aliases](common-concepts/browser-aliases.md).
A list of all the available aliases can be obtained by the [--list-browsers](#-b---list-browsers) command.

The following example demonstrates how to run a test in several browsers.
The browsers are specified differently: one by using the alias, the other by using the path.

```sh
testcafe chrome,/applications/safari.app tests/sample-fixture.js
```

To run tests against **all installed browsers**, use the `all` alias.

```sh
testcafe all tests/sample-fixture.js
```

### Remote Browsers

To run tests on a remote browser, specify `remote` as a browser alias.

```sh
testcafe remote tests/sample-fixture.js
```

If you want to connect multiple browsers,
prefix an alias with the number of browsers you want to connect. For example, if you need to use three remote browsers, specify *3remote*.

```sh
testcafe 3remote tests/sample-fixture.js
```

TestCafe will provide URLs that you need to open in required browsers on your remote device.

You can also use the [--qr-code](#--qr-code) option to display QR-codes that represent the same URLs.
Scan the QR-codes by a device on which you are going to test the application.
As a result, the browsers will be connected to TestCafe and tests will start.

## File Path/Glob Pattern

The `file-or-glob ...` argument specifies files or directories (separated by a space) to run tests from.

For example, this command runs all tests located in the `my-tests` directory.

```sh
testcafe ie my-tests
```

The following command runs tests from the specified fixture files.

```sh
testcafe ie my-tests/fixture1.js my-tests/fixture2.js
```

You can also use [globbing patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) to specify a set of files.
For example, this command runs tests from files that match `tests/*page*`, namely `tests/example-page.js` and `tests/main-page.js`.

```sh
testcafe ie tests/*page*
```

If you do not specify any file or directory, TestCafe will run tests from `test` or `tests` directories.

## Options

### -h, --help

Displays usage information for commands.

```sh
testcafe --help
```

### -v, --version

Displays the TestCafe version.

```sh
testcafe --version
```

### -b, --list-browsers

Lists [aliases](common-concepts/browser-aliases.md) of the browsers available on this computer.

```sh
testcafe --list-browsers
```

### -r \<name\>, --reporter \<name\>

Specifies the name of the [built-in](/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/common-concepts/reporters/) or [custom reporter](/testcafe/documentation/extending-testcafe/creating-custom-reporter/) that will be used to generate test reports.

The following command runs tests in all available browsers and generates a report in the xunit format.

```sh
testcafe all tests/sample-fixture.js -r xunit
```

The following command runs tests and generates a test report by using the custom plugin reporter.

```sh
testcafe all tests/sample-fixture.js -r my-reporter
```

A generated test report will be displayed in the command prompt window.

If you need to save a report to an external file, you can redirect the command output stream to a file
by using the > redirection operator and specifying a report file path.

```sh
testcafe all tests/sample-fixture.js > tests/test-results.txt
```

### -s \<path\>, --screenshots \<path\>

Enables screenshot capturing and specifies the directory path
to save the screenshots to.

```sh
testcafe all tests/sample-fixture.js -s screenshots
```

### -S, --screenshots-on-fails

Takes a screenshot whenever a test fails. Screenshots are saved to the directory
specified by using the **-screenshots \<path\>** option.

For example, the following command runs tests from the
  `sample-fixture.js` file in all browsers, takes screenshots if tests fail
  and saves the screenshots to the `screenshots` directory.

```sh
testcafe all tests/sample-fixture.js -S -s screenshots
```

### -q, --quarantine-mode

Enables the quarantine mode for tests that fail.
In this mode, a failed test is executed several more times.
The test result depends on the outcome (*passed* or *failed*) that will be at most.
That is, if the test fails on most attempts, the result is *failed*.
And vice versa, if the test is executed successfully in most of attempts, the result is *passed*.

If the test result differs between runs, the test is marked as unstable.

```sh
testcafe all tests/sample-fixture.js -q
```

### -e, --skip-js-errors

Makes tests not fail when a JavaScript error occurs on a tested web page.
By default, in case of such errors, TestCafe stops test execution and posts
an error message to a report. If you want TestCafe to ignore JavaScript errors,
specify this argument.

For example, the following command runs tests from the specified file and forces TestCafe to ignore JavaScript errors.

```sh
testcafe ie tests/sample-fixture.js -e
```

### -t \<name\>,  --test \<name\>

TestCafe will run a test with the specified name.

For example, the following command runs only the `"Click a label"` test from the `sample-fixture.js` file.

```sh
testcafe ie tests/sample-fixture.js -t "Click a label"
```

### -T \<pattern\>, --test-grep \<pattern\>

TestCafe will run tests whose names match the specified pattern.

For example, the following command runs the tests whose names match `Click*`. These can be the `Click a label`, `Click a button` tests and so on.

```sh
testcafe ie my-tests -T Click*
```

### -f \<name\>, --fixture \<name\>

TestCafe will run a fixture with the specified name.

```sh
testcafe ie my-tests -f sample-fixture
```

### -F \<pattern\>, --fixture-grep \<pattern\>

TestCafe will run fixtures whose names match the specified pattern.

```sh
testcafe ie my-tests --fixture-grep *Page*
```

### --ports \<port1,port2\>

Specifies the custom port numbers used by TestCafe to perform testing. Number [0-65535].

If ports are not specified, TestCafe selects ports.

### --hostname \<name\>

Specifies the hostname of your computer. It is used when running tests on [remote browsers](#remote-browsers).

If it is not specified, TestCafe will use operating system hostname or network IP address of the current machine.

### --qr-code

Outputs QR-code that represents URLs used to connect the [remote browsers](#remote-browsers).

```sh
testcafe remote my-tests --qr-code
```

### --color

Forces colors in the command line.

### --no-color

Disables colors in the command line.
