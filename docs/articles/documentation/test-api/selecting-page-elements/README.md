# Selecting Page Elements

TestCafe runs test code on the server. When you need to refer to a DOM element
to perform an action on it, you can pass CSS selectors to the appropriate [action](../actions/README.md) function.

However, there are cases when you may need direct access to DOM elements.
For instance, you need to know the state of a particular page element to make an [assertion](../assertions/README.md).
You may also find CSS selectors not powerful enough to identify an element on which you need to perform an action.

To address these scenarios, TestCafe introduces the *selector* functions.
A Selector identifies a webpage element in the test and allow to get its state and
use it in actions and assertions.
