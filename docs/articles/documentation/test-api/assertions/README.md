# Assertions

To check if the state of the tested webpage matches the one you expect to see, use *assertions*.

TestCafe provides a comprehensive set of assertions that are based on Behavior Driven Development style (BDD-style).
See [Assertion API](assertion-api.md).

This topic contains the following sections.

* [Assertion Structure](#assertion-structure)
* [Smart Assertion Query Mechanism](#smart-assertion-query-mechanism)
* [Assertion options](#assertion-options)
  * [options.timeout](#optionstimeout)

## Assertion Structure

TestCafe assertions start with the `expect` method exposed by [test controller](../test-code-structure.html#test-controller).
This method accepts the actual value. You can pass a value, a [Selector's DOM node state property](../selecting-page-elements/selectors.md#define-assertion-actual-value)
or a [client function](../obtaining-data-from-the-client.md) promise.
TestCafe automatically waits for node state properties to obtain a value and for client functions to execute.
See [Smart Assertion Query Mechanism](#smart-assertion-query-mechanism) for details.

After `expect`, an [assertion method](assertion-api.md) follows. Assertion methods accept an expected value
and, optionally, other arguments.

For instance, the deep equality assertion has the following structure.

```text
await t.expect( actual ).eql( expected, message, options );
```

The sample below demonstrates how to use assertions:

```js
import { Selector } from 'testcafe';


fixture `Example page`
   .page `http://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/example/`;


test('Check property of element', async t => {
   const developerNameInput = Selector('#developer-name');

   await t
       .expect(developerNameInput.value).eql('', 'input is empty')
       .typeText(developerNameInput, 'Peter Parker')
       .expect(developerNameInput.value).contains('Peter', 'input contains text "Peter"');
});
```

## Smart Assertion Query Mechanism

In synchronous functional testing, you can perform the required assertions immediately after test action is executed:

![Synchronous Functional Testing](../../../images/assertions/synchronous-testing.png)

On the web, functional tests are asynchronous. This means that we can not get the expected changes immediately after an end-user action.
For example, the tested web page can send a request to the server for the required data, and this can take some time;
or an end-user action launches animation after which the web page will reach its final state.
All of these time gaps cannot be pre-calculated, because they depend on various factors: computer performance,
network connection speed, etc. In this case, if we perform assertions immediately after the test action finished,
we can get an indefinite result:

![Asynchronous Functional Testing](../../../images/assertions/asynchronous-testing.png)

To perform asynchronous functional tests, an additional timeout as usually added:

![Asynchronous Functional Testing with Extra Waiting](../../../images/assertions/extra-waiting.png)

To stabilize such tests, you need to add a timeout that will guarantee that the required changes are successfully applied.
Adding such timeouts can increase the test running time because of extra waiting.

If the TestCafe assertion receives a [Selector's DOM node state property](../selecting-page-elements/selectors.md#define-assertion-actual-value)
or a [client function](../obtaining-data-from-the-client.md) promise
as an actual value, TestCafe uses the smart assertion query mechanism:
if an assertion did not pass, the test does not fail immediately. The assertion retries to pass multiple times and
each time it requests the actual property value. The test fails if the assertion could not complete successfully
within a timeout:

![TestCafe Smart Assertion Query Mechanism](../../../images/assertions/query-mechanism.png)

**Example:**

Assume you have the following web page.

```html
<div id="btn"></div>
<script>
var btn = document.getElementById('btn');

btn.addEventListener(function() {
    window.setTimeout(function() {
        btn.innerText = 'Loading...';
    }, 100);
});
</script>
```

Test code for this page can be as follows.

```js
test('Button click', async t => {
    const btn = Selector('#btn');

    await t
        .click(btn)
        // A regular assertion will fail immediately, but TestCafe retries to run DOM state
        // assertions many times within the timeout until this assertion passes successfully.
        // The default timeout is 3000 ms.
        .expect(btn.textContent).contains('Loading...');
});
```

The approach described above allows you to create stable tests free from random errors and running fast without additional waiting.

You can specify the assertion query timeout in test code by using the [options.timeout](#assertion-options) option.
To set the timeout when launching tests, pass the timeout value to the [runner.run](../../using-testcafe/programming-interface/runner.md#run)
method if you use API or specify the [assertion-timeout](../../using-testcafe/command-line-interface.md#--assertion-timeout-ms) option
if you run TestCafe from the command line.

## Assertion options

### options.timeout

**Type**: Number

The amount of time, in milliseconds, allowed for an assertion to pass before the test fails if
[a selector property](../selecting-page-elements/selectors.md#define-assertion-actual-value)
or a [client function](../obtaining-data-from-the-client.md) promise was used in assertion.

**Default value**: timeout is specified by using the [runner.run](../../using-testcafe/programming-interface/runner.md#run) API method
or the [assertion-timeout](../../using-testcafe/command-line-interface.md#--assertion-timeout-ms) command line option.

```js
await t.expect(Selector('#elementId').innerText).eql('text', 'check element text', { timeout: 500 });
```

> In addition to built-in assertions, you also can use assertions from Node's built-in [assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module or choose a 3rd-party library you like (for example [chai](http://chaijs.com/)).
> In this case, you should care about the amount of time required to complete asynchronous actions using the [t.wait(timeout)](../pausing-the-test.md) method.
