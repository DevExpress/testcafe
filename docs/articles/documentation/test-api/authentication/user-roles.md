# User Roles

Many test scenarios involve the activity of more than one user. TestCafe addresses these scenarios by providing a convenient way
to isolate authentication test actions and apply them easily whenever you need to switch the user account.

A piece of logic that logs in a particular user is called a *role*. Define a role for each user account participating in your test.

## Creating and Using Roles

Use the `Role` constructor to create and initialize a role.

```text
Role( url, func( t ) )
```

Parameter | Type     | Description
--------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`url`     | String   | The URL of the login page.
`func`    | Function | An asynchronous function that contains logic that authenticates the user.
`t`       | Object   | The [test controller](../test-code-structure.md#test-controller) used to access test run API.

```js
import { Role } from 'testcafe';

const regularAccUser = Role('http://example.com/login', async t => {
    await t
        .typeText('#login', 'TestUser')
        .typeText('#password', 'testpass')
        .click('#sign-in');
});

const facebookAccUser = Role('http://example.com/login', async t => {
    await t
        .click('#sign-in-with-facebook')
        .typeText('#email', 'testuser@mycompany.com')
        .typeText('#pass', 'testpass')
        .click('#submit');
});

const admin = Role('http://example.com/login', async t => {
    await t
        .typeText('#login', 'Admin')
        .typeText('#password', 'adminpass')
        .click('#sign-in');
});
```

> Role initialization code is executed only once when the role is used for the first time.

After you create the roles, you can switch between users at any moment except for the role initialization code.

If you switch to a role for the first time in test run, the browser will be navigated from the original page to a login page where the role initialization code will be executed. Then the original page will be reloaded with new credentials. If you switch to a role that has already been initialized, TestCafe simply reloads the current page with the appropriate credentials.

To switch to a role, use the `t.useRole` function.

```text
t.useRole( role )
```

Parameter | Type   | Description
--------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------
`role`    | Object | The role you need to use further in the test.

```js
import { Selector } from 'testcafe';

const entry        = Selector('#entry');
const removeButton = Selector('#remove-entry');

fixture `My Fixture`
    .page `http://example.com`;

test('test that involves two users', async t => {
    await t
        .useRole(regularAccUser)
        .expect(entry.exists).ok()
        .expect(removeButton.visible).notOk()
        .useRole(admin)
        .expect(removeButton.visible).ok()
        .click(removeButton)
        .expect(entry.exists).notOk()
});
```

Roles can be shared across tests and fixtures. You can create roles in a separate helper file and use them in any test fixture that references this file.

When you switch to a role for the first time, TestCafe internally creates a *branch* of this role for this particular test run. All cookies set by your further actions will be appended to this branch. This branch will be used whenever you switch back to this role from the same test run.

For instance, assume that you switch to a role that logs you in on **website A**. After you switch to this role, you log in to **website B** in test code. TestCafe adds the new cookie to the role branch. If you switch to a different role and then back to the initial role in the same test run, you will be logged to **both website A and B**. If you switch to this role in a different test, you will be logged in to **website A** only.

If a website uses [HTTP Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) or [Windows (NTLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT_LAN_Manager) authentication, use the approach described in [HTTP Authentication](http-authentication.md).

## Anonymous Role

You can switch back to an unregistered user by using an anonymous role. This role is returned by the static `Role.anonymous()` function.

```js
import { Selector, Role } from 'testcafe';

fixture `My Fixture`;

test('Anonymous users can see newly created comments', async t => {
    await t
        .useRole(registeredUser)
        .navigateTo('http://example.org')
        .typeText('#comment', 'Hey ya!')
        .click('#submit')
        .useRole(Role.anonymous());

        var comment = await Selector('#comment-data');

        await t.expect(comment.innerText).eql('Hey ya!');
});
```
