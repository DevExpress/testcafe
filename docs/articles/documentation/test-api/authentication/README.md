# Authentication

Topics in this section describe how to authenticate to the tested web app.

TestCafe provides API for [HTTP Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) and [NTLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT_LAN_Manager) authentication.

* [HTTP/NTLM Authentication](http-authentication.md)

For authentication performed with on-page user actions, use roles.
