# Run Tests on Sauce Labs with Travis CI

You can automatically run tests as a part of your build process using TestCafe and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).
TestCafe also allows you to use [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) browsers for testing.
Thus, you can run your tests completely in the cloud.

Suppose you have a GitHub project for which you need to automatically run tests in the cloud when the project is modified. To do this, go through the following steps.

* [Step 1 - Install TestCafe and create tests](#step-1---install-testcafe-and-create-tests)
* [Step 2 - Enable Travis for your project](#step-2---enable-travis-for-your-project)
* [Step 3 - Configure Travis to use Sauce Labs](#step-3---configure-travis-to-use-sauce-labs)
* [Step 4 - Install the Sauce Labs browser provider plugin](#step-4---install-the-sauce-labs-browser-provider-plugin)
* [Step 5 - Add the `test` script to package.json](#step-5---add-the-test-script-to-packagejson)
* [Step 6 - Trigger a Travis CI build](#step-6---trigger-a-travis-ci-build)

> TestCafe provides an [example](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/tree/master/examples/running-tests-using-travis-and-saucelabs/) that can show you how to run tests with Travis CI and Sauce Labs.

## Step 1 - Install TestCafe and Create Tests

Install TestCafe [locally](../basic-guides/install-testcafe.md#local-installation) in your project and [create tests](../../getting-started/README.md#creating-a-test).

## Step 2 - Enable Travis for Your Project

1. [Sign in to Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/auth) with your GitHub account. Travis CI will synchronize your repositories from GitHub. You can see them on your [profile page](https://travis-ci.org/profile).
2. Enable Travis CI for a repository you want to build by flicking the switch on.

     ![Enable Travis for a repository](../../../images/travis-step-2-2.png)

     By default, Travis CI runs builds on pushes and pull requests. You can manage this behavior in your repository's settings.

3. Add a `.travis.yml` configuration file to the root of your project. This file contains parameters and commands that instruct Travis CI how to execute your builds. For more information, see [Customizing the Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build).

     For Node.js projects, the `.travis.yml` file can have the following content.

     ```yaml
     language: node_js
     node_js: "stable"
  
     before_install:
       - stty cols 80
     ```

     Commit and push this file to your repository.

## Step 3 - Configure Travis to Use Sauce Labs

1. Save your Sauce Labs username and access key to the SAUCE\_USERNAME and SAUCE\_ACCESS\_KEY environment variables, as described in [SauceLabs documentation](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Best+Practice%3A+Use+Environment+Variables+for+Authentication+Credentials).
2. Go to the repository settings in Travis CI. In the **Environment Variables** section, define the SAUCE\_USERNAME and SAUCE\_ACCESS\_KEY variables (see [Defining Variables in Repository Settings](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings)).

## Step 4 - Install the Sauce Labs Browser Provider Plugin

To run TestCafe tests in the cloud using Sauce Labs browsers, you need to install the [testcafe-browser-provider-saucelabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testcafe-browser-provider-saucelabs) plugin locally to your project.
To do this, run the following command.

```bash
npm install --save-dev testcafe-browser-provider-saucelabs
```

For more information on testing in cloud browsers, see [Browsers in Cloud Testing Services](../concepts/browsers.md#browsers-in-cloud-testing-services).

## Step 5 - Add the `test` Script to package.json

To test a project, Travis runs test scripts. For Node.js projects, the default test script is `npm test`.
To tell npm how to run your tests, add the `test` script to the project's package.json file. Use `testcafe` command in the script to run tests on a Sauce Labs browser.

```text
"scripts": {
    "test":  "testcafe \"saucelabs:Chrome@beta:Windows 10\" tests/index-test.js"
}
```

For more information on how to configure a test run using a `testcafe` command, see [Command Line Interface](../../reference/command-line-interface.md).

**Note:** If your app requires starting a custom web server, use the `--app` TestCafe option to specify a command that starts your server.
This command will be automatically executed before running tests. After tests are finished, TestCafe will stop the app server.

```text
"scripts": {
  "test":  "testcafe \"saucelabs:Chrome@beta:Windows 10\" tests/index-test.js --app \"node server.js\""
}
```

## Step 6 - Trigger a Travis CI Build

You can trigger a Travis CI build by pushing commits to your repository or creating a pull request.

To check if the build passed or failed, go to the [build status page](https://travis-ci.org/repositories).
