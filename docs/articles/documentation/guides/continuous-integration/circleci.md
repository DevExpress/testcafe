# Integrate TestCafe With CircleCI

This topic describes how to integrate TestCafe tests into a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) project's build process.

## Prerequisites

In this tutorial you fetch tests from a GitHub repository: [testcafe-ci-demo](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/testcafe-ci-demo). Fork this repository before you begin.

> If you use a different version control system, make sure CircleCI supports it. To learn which systems it supports, refer to the [CircleCI Integrations](https://circleci.com/integrations/) page.

## Step 1 - Install TestCafe and Create Tests

To run TestCafe, install it [locally](../basic-guides/install-testcafe.md#local-installation) in your project and [create tests](../../getting-started/README.md#creating-a-test).

To see test results in the CircleCI UI, install the [testcafe-reporter-xunit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testcafe-reporter-xunit) npm package.
This JUnit XML reporter generates test run reports in the XML format. CircleCI can process XML reports and display test results in the UI.

For more information about reporters, see [Reporters](../concepts/reporters.md).

Run the following command to install the packages locally in your project directory:

```sh
npm install --save-dev testcafe testcafe-reporter-xunit
```

Commit the `package-lock.json` file generated by npm into the repository. This file allows CircleCI to use a fast `npm ci` command to install the dependencies.

## Step 2 - Create a New CircleCI Project

Log in to CircleCI with your GitHub account.

When you launch CircleCI for the first time, you start from an empty workspace. Click the **Add Project** button to create your first project.

![Click the Add Project Button](../../../images/circle-ci/add-project.png)

The list of GitHub projects associated with your account appears.

Find `testcafe-ci-demo` and click **Set Up project**.

## Step 3 - Configure the Build

On the project configuration page, select **Node** as the target platform and paste the following configuration:

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  node: circleci/node@4.1.0
  browser-tools: circleci/browser-tools@1.1.0
jobs:
  test:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:lts-browsers
    steps:
      - checkout
      - browser-tools/install-browser-tools
      - node/install-packages
      - run:
          command: npm run test
      - store_test_results:
          path: /tmp/test-results
workflows:
  e2e-test:
    jobs:
      - test
```

The table below describes the YAML properties used in this example:

Property                | Description
----------------------- | ----
`version`               | The CircleCI version that should be used for this project.
`orbs`                  | Imports CircleCI [orbs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/)â€“reusable parts of build configurations stored in a CircleCI registry.
`node`                  | Imports the [circleci/node](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node) orb v4.1.0 under the name `node`.
`browser-tools`         | Imports the [circleci/browser-tools](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/browser-tools) orb v1.1.0 under the name `browser-tools`.
`jobs`                  | The section that specifies [jobs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/jobs-steps/#jobs-overview).
`test`                  | The job's name.
`docker`                | An [executor](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#docker--machine--macos--windows-executor) that defines that defines the environment in which this job runs. The `docker` executor specifies that the job should run inside a docker container.
`image`                 | Specifies the docker image to use. `cimg/node:lts-browsers` is a pre-built CircleCI docker image with the `lts` version of node and browser dependencies pre-installed. For the full list of available images, see [Pre-Built CircleCI Docker Images](https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node).
`steps`                 | The job's [steps](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/jobs-steps/#steps-overview).
`checkout`              | Checks out code from the `testcafe-ci-demo` repository. This is a pre-defined step (see [checkout](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#checkout)).
`browser-tools/install-browser-tools` | A step from the `browser-tools` orb that installs browsers and browser drivers on the machine. This step installs Chrome, Firefox, ChromeDriver and GeckoDriver.
`node/install-packages` | A step from the `node` orb that installs the project's dependencies (see [install-packages](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node#commands-install-packages)).
`run`                   | The [run](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#run) step invokes shell commands. In this example, `run` executes the `npm test` script.
`store_test_results`    | Uploads test results to the specified directory (see [store_test_results](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#store_test_results)).
`workflows`             | A [workflow](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/) that runs the `test` job.

After you pasted the YAML, click **Add Config**.

![Click Add Config to save the configuration](../../../images/circle-ci/circleci-config.png)

This config is added to the new `circleci-project-setup` branch. Merge this file into your working branch.

```sh
git checkout master
git merge circleci-project-setup
```

## Step 4 - Add the `test` Script to package.json

To specify how CircleCI should launch TestCafe, add the `test` script to the project's `package.json` file. Use the `testcafe` command in the script to run tests in Chrome in the headless mode. Add the `-r` flag to use the JUnit XML reporter.

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "testcafe chrome:headless tests/**/* -r xunit:/tmp/test-results/testcafe/results.xml"
}
```

After you install the dependencies and specify the `test` script, `package.json` should look as follows:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "testcafe chrome:headless tests/**/* -r xunit:/tmp/test-results/testcafe/results.xml"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "testcafe": "*",
    "testcafe-reporter-xunit": "*"
  }
}
```

For more information on how to configure a test run with the `testcafe` command, see [Command Line Interface](../../reference/command-line-interface.md).

## Step 5 - View Test Results

Commit the changes to trigger the build. CircleCI Dashboard shows the results in the pipeline.

Click the job name to see the details.

![View the pipeline in the Dashboard](../../../images/circle-ci/view-pipeline.png)

The `Steps` panel displays information about the completed job including the run duration, latest commit, and build log:

![Job details in the Dashboard](../../../images/circle-ci/view-steps.png)

The `Tests` panel displays test results. If errors occur, the report is shown.
