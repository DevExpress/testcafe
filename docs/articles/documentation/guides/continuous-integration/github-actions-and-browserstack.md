# Run Tests on BrowserStack with GitHub Actions

This topic describes how to use the [Run TestCafe action](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-action) to integrate TestCafe into the [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions) build process. Tests are executed in the [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com/) cloud testing service.

## Step 1 - Create a Workflow

Create a YAML file (for instance, `testcafe-workflow.yml`) in the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.

Specify the [workflow name](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#name) and the [event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) that triggers this workflow.

```yml
name: End-to-End Tests
on: [push]
```

In this example, the workflow runs when you push changes to the repository.

## Step 2 - Create a Job

Create a job that runs the TestCafe tests.

Specify the [job name](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idname) and the [type of machine](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on) that should run the job.

You can [**use a GitHub-hosted machine**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners):

```yml
name: End-to-End Tests
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run TestCafe Tests
    runs-on: windows-latest
```

This job runs on a GitHub-hosted virtual machine with the latest Windows version. `test` is the [job ID](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_id) that must be unique to the `jobs` object.

> You can use a GitHub-hosted virtual machine with a variety of operating systems to access remote browsers, as listed on the following page: [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on). For simplicity, all examples in this article run on `windows-latest`.

You can [**host your own runners**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) for the job. This gives you more precise control over the environment.

To set up the self-hosted runners, [add them to your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-a-repository).

Afterwards, configure `runs-on` in your workflow `.yml` file:

```yml
name: End-to-End Tests
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run TestCafe Tests
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux]
```

> Make sure that the intended machine meets the [requirements for self-hosted runner machines](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#requirements-for-self-hosted-runner-machines).
>
>For more information about self-hosted runners in the GitHub Actions workflow, refer to the following topic: [Using self-hosted runners in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow).

## Step 3 - Provide BrowserStack Credentials

In order for TestCafe to use BrowserStack browsers, valid BrowserStack credentials (Username and Access Key) are required. These credentials are unique to your BrowserStack account and can be obtained from the **Account Settings** page.

Values should be set to `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables, respectively. However, for security purposes, you should provide them as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in your repository.

After adding the secrets, add the following content to the [env](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#env) in your workflow YAML file:

{% raw %}

```yml
name: End-to-End Tests
on: [push]
env:
        BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY: "${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY }}"
        BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME: "${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME }}"
jobs:
  test:
    name: Run TestCafe Tests
    runs-on: windows-latest
```

{% endraw %}

## Step 4 - Add a Step that Fetches the Repository

Add a [step](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps) that uses the [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action to fetch your repository content.

{% raw %}

```yml
name: End-to-End Tests
on: [push]
env:
        BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY: "${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY }}"
        BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME: "${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME }}"
jobs:
  test:
    name: Run TestCafe Tests
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
```

{% endraw %}

## Step 5 - Add a Step to Install the TestCafe BrowserStack Plugin

To enable TestCafe to run in the BrowserStack environment, install our [browserstack plugin](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-browser-provider-browserstack).

{% raw %}

```yml
name: End-to-End Tests
on: [push]
env:
        BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY: "${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY }}"
        BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME: "${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME }}"
jobs:
  test:
    name: Run TestCafe Tests
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Install TestCafe BrowserStack plugin
        run: npm install testcafe-browser-provider-browserstack
```

{% endraw %}

## Step 6 - Add a Step that Runs TestCafe

Add the [Run TestCafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-action) action. Use the [args](#args) parameter to provide TestCafe [command line arguments](../../reference/command-line-interface.md), including the BrowserStack configuration:

{% raw %}

```yml
name: End-to-End Tests
on: [push]
env:
        BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY: "${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY }}"
        BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME: "${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME }}"
jobs:
  test:
    name: Run TestCafe Tests
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Install TestCafe BrowserStack plugin
        run: npm install testcafe-browser-provider-browserstack
      - name: Run tests
        uses: DevExpress/testcafe-action@latest
        with:
            args: "'browserstack:chrome@84.0:Windows 10' tests"
```

{% endraw %}

> Note the additional pair of single quotes in the `args` section. The BrowserStack configuration string includes a space, which can be interpreted as a separator by the command line.

**Note**: A full list of available BrowserStack configurations can be obtained through the console.
First, provide your credentials by exporting them:

**bash**

```sh
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME="<your_browserstack_username>"
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY="<your_browserstack_access_key>"
```

**PowerShell**

```sh
Set-Variable -Name "BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME" -Value "<your_browserstack_username>"
Set-Variable -Name "BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY" -Value "<your_browserstack_access_key>"
```

Then, run the following command in the console:

```sh
testcafe -b browserstack
```

## Action Options

### args

TestCafe [command line arguments](../../reference/command-line-interface.md).

```yml
- uses: DevExpress/testcafe-action@latest
  with:
    args: "'browserstack:chrome@84.0:Windows 10' fixture.js -s takeOnFails=true -q -c 3"
```

### version

*Optional*

The TestCafe version to install.

```yml
- uses: DevExpress/testcafe-action@latest
  with:
    version: "1.6.0"
    args: "'browserstack:chrome@84.0:Windows 10' tests"
```

To start the build, commit changes and push to the repository. You can see the results on the `Actions` page in your repository.

## Example

The following example runs TestCafe tests across different browser versions and operating systems provided by BrowserStack.

{% raw %}

```yml
name: End-to-End Tests
on: [push]
env:
      BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME }}
      BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY }}
jobs:  
  windows10_test:
    name: Run Windows 10 TestCafe Tests
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Install TestCafe BrowserStack plugin
        run: npm install testcafe-browser-provider-browserstack
      - name: Run Windows 10 Chrome@84.0 test
        uses: DevExpress/testcafe-action@latest
        with:
            args: "'browserstack:chrome@84.0:Windows 10' tests"
  windows8-1_test:
    name: Run Windows 8.1 TestCafe Tests
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Install TestCafe BrowserStack plugin
        run: npm install testcafe-browser-provider-browserstack
      - name: Run Windows 8.1 Firefox@78.0 test
        uses: DevExpress/testcafe-action@latest
        with:
            args: "'browserstack:firefox@78.0:Windows 8.1' tests"
```

{% endraw %}
