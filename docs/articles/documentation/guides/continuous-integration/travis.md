# Run Tests in Travis CI

You can automatically run tests as a part of your build process using TestCafe and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).
There are Linux versions of Chrome and Firefox browsers available for Travis CI builds, so you can run your tests completely in the cloud.

Suppose you have a GitHub project for which you need to automatically run tests in the cloud when the project is modified. To do this, go through the following steps.

* [Step 1 - Install TestCafe and create tests](#step-1---install-testcafe-and-create-tests)
* [Step 2 - Enable Travis for your project](#step-2---enable-travis-for-your-project)
* [Step 3 - Configure Travis to use Xvfb](#step-3---configure-travis-to-use-xvfb)
* [Step 4 - Add the `test` script to package.json](#step-4---add-the-test-script-to-packagejson)
* [Step 5 - Trigger a Travis CI build](#step-5---trigger-a-travis-ci-build)

> TestCafe provides an [example](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/tree/master/examples/running-tests-in-firefox-and-chrome-using-travis-ci/) that can show you how to run tests in Chrome and Firefox with Travis CI.

## Step 1 - Install TestCafe and create tests

Install TestCafe [locally](../basic-guides/install-testcafe.md#local-installation) in your project and [create tests](../../getting-started/README.md#creating-a-test).

## Step 2 - Enable Travis for your project

1. [Sign in to Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/auth) with your GitHub account. Travis CI will synchronize your repositories from GitHub. You can see them on your [profile page](https://travis-ci.org/profile).
2. Enable Travis CI for a repository you want to build by flicking the switch on.

     By default, Travic CI runs builds on pushes and pull requests. You can manage this behavior in your repository's settings.

3. Add a `.travis.yml` configuration file to the root of your project. This file contains parameters and commands that instruct Travis CI how to execute your builds. For more information, see [Customizing the Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build).

     For Node.js projects, the `.travis.yml` file can have the following content.

     ```yaml
     language: node_js
     node_js: "stable"
  
     before_install:
        - stty cols 80
     ```

     Commit and push this file to your repository.

## Step 3 - Configure Travis to use Xvfb

Travis CI uses Ubuntu Server virtual machines that do not have regular graphical environment like Unity, GNOME or KDE installed, so you have to setup and use [Xvfb](https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) to run browsers headlessly.

The following sections are required in your `.travis.yml` to start `Xvfb`:

```yaml
dist: bionic

addons:
  firefox: latest
  chrome: stable

services:
  - xvfb

language: node_js
node_js: 'stable'

before_script:
  - fluxbox >/dev/null 2>&1 &
  - sleep 3
```

You can find more information about Travis and Xvfb in [this article](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/#Using-xvfb-to-Run-Tests-That-Require-a-GUI).

## Step 4 - Add the `test` script to package.json

To test a project, Travis runs test scripts. For Node.js projects, the default test script is `npm test`.
To tell npm how to run your tests, add the `test` script to the project's package.json file. Use `testcafe` command in the script to run tests in Chrome and Firefox.

```text
"scripts": {
    "test":  "testcafe chrome,firefox tests/index-test.js"
}
```

For more information on how to configure a test run using a `testcafe` command, see [Command Line Interface](../../reference/command-line-interface.md).

**Note:** If your app requires starting a custom web server, use the `--app` TestCafe option to specify a command that starts your server.
This command will be automatically executed before running tests. After tests are finished, TestCafe will stop the app server.

```text
"scripts": {
  "test":  "testcafe chrome,firefox tests/index-test.js --app \"node server.js\""
}
```

## Step 5 - Trigger a Travis CI build

You can trigger a Travis CI build by pushing commits to your repository or creating a pull request.

To check if the build passed or failed, go to the [build status page](https://travis-ci.org/repositories).
