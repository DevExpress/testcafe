Specifies the credentials for HTTP [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) and [Windows (NTLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Windows_Authentication) authentication.

{% include authentication/http-credentials.md %}

TestCafe uses credentials specified with `test.httpAuth` for all requests that require authentication in the test. To specify credentials for all tests in a fixture, use the [fixture.httpAuth](../fixture/httpauth.md) method.
