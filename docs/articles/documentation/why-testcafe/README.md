# Why TestCafe?

TestCafe excels where other end-to-end testing solutions fall short.

## One NPM package

TestCafe doesn't require the use of extra tools and frameworks. All you need to get up and running is a recent version of Node.js, a browser — any browser, and the TestCafe NPM package.

## As simple and extendable as JavaScript itself

TestCafe tests are full-fledged Node.js apps. They are compatible with your favourite JavaScript libraries and preprocessors.

## Complex tests made easy

TestCafe’s intuitive and powerful toolkit makes testing easy, whether you’re working with a landing page or a complex web app.

### Mock Requests
Emulate HTTP responses to feed your app sample data, troubleshoot connectivity errors and cheat downtime.

### Client-side injections
Execute custom client-side code to parse the web page, examine its state, or even add extra dependencies.

### Frames and windows
Make use of multiple browser windows to test out complex user interactions. Switch to and from iframes with ease and stability.

### Concurrent tests
Run your tests in multiple browsers at once to quickly uncover browser-specific errors.

## Automate what’s possible

### Automated waiting
Manual timeouts are a thing of the past. Asynchronous from the ground-up, TestCafe knows when to wait and what to wait for before the test can continue.

### Automated authentication scripts
Save and activate user roles to easily switch between different user accounts.

### Hooks
Keep your code clean with hooks — routines that are repeated before and after each test.

## Interactive when you need it

### TestCafe Studio
Use a GUI test recorder that makes the power of TestCafe accessible to people with zero programming experience.

### Live mode
Instantly see how the changes you introduce impact the test.

### Debug mode
Pause your tests to examine the app and troubleshoot errors.

## Community-driven

### Free and Open Source
TestCafe is distributed for free under the MIT license.

### Actively maintained
The TestCafe team is quick to respond to GitHub issues and StackOverflow questions. Community suggestions shape the future of the product.

### In-house support
All TestCafe Studio Pro customers (subscribers and trial users alike) receive prompt, proactive support directly from the package maintainers.
