# Debugging with Chrome Developer Tools

Starting with version 6.3.0, Node.js allows you to debug applications in Chrome Developer Tools.
If you have Chrome and an appropriate version of Node.js installed on your machine,
you can debug TestCafe test code.
To do this, add the `--inspect` and `--debug-brk` flags to the test run command.

```sh
testcafe --inspect --debug-brk chrome ./tests
```

Put the `debugger` keyword in test code where you want to stop.

```js
fixture `My fixture`
    .page `https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/example`;

test('My test', async t => {
    debugger;
    await t
        .click('#populate')
        .click('#submit-button');
});
```

After the test run command is executed, a debugging URL will appear in the console.

Open this URL in a new Chrome instance. Chrome will invoke its Developer Tools and the debugger will stop test execution at the first line.
Click the 'Resume script execution' button or press F5 to continue. After that, text execution will pause at the `debugger` keyword allowing you to debug test code.
