# Extract Reusable Test Code

It is a good practice to extract reusable test code to separate files. We recommend that you [use a page model pattern](use-page-model.md) for this. It allows you to abstract out both page structure and test logic.

However, if you need to extract only the helper functions, you can [export them from a separate script file](create-helpers.md).

* [Use Page Model](use-page-model.md)
* [Create Helpers](create-helpers.md)
