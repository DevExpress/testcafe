The quickest way to have E2E tests is to do them manually, but repetitive manual work costs far too much for a company. Automation can help reduce the costs of running End-to-End tests and increase the confidence of a team at the same time. It's true that configuring an E2E test runner and including it into our development workflow isn't an easy task, but once you're done, you never look back. We benefit from more confidence in our code with every single test written, and ensure that the combined pieces of an application, or system, work in perfect harmony."
