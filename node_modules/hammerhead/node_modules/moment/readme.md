[Moment.js](http://momentjs.com)
================================

A lightweight javascript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.

### [Check out the website](http://momentjs.com)

### [Read the documentation](http://momentjs.com/docs/)

### [Run the unit tests](http://momentjs.com/test/)


Upgrading to 1.6.0
==================

There are a few things being deprecated in the 1.6.0 release.

1. The format tokens `z` and `zz` (timezone abbreviations like EST CST MST etc) will no longer be supported. Due to inconsistent browser support, we are unable to consistently produce this value. See [this issue](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues/162) for more background.

2. The method `moment.fn.native` is deprecated in favor of `moment.fn.toDate`. There continue to be issues with Google Closure Compiler throwing errors when using `native`, even in valid instances.

3. The way to customize am/pm strings is being changed. This would only affect you if you created a custom language file. For more information, see [this issue](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/pull/222).


Contributing
============

To contribute, fork the library and install these npm packages.

    npm install jshint uglify-js nodeunit

You can add tests to the files in `/test/moment` or add a new test file if you are adding a new feature.

To run the tests, do `make test` to run all tests, `make test-moment` to test the core library, and `make test-lang` to test all the languages.

To check the filesize, you can use `make size`.

To minify all the files, use `make moment` to minify moment, `make langs` to minify all the lang files, or just `make` to minfy everything.

If your code passes the unit tests (including the ones you wrote), submit a pull request.

Submitting pull requests
========================

Moment.js now uses [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow). If you're not familiar with git-flow, please read up on it, you'll be glad you did.

When submitting new features, please create a new feature branch using `git flow feature start <name>` and submit the pull request to the `develop` branch.

Pull requests for enhancements for features should be submitted to the `develop` branch as well.

When submitting a bugfix, please check if there is an existing bugfix branch. If the latest stable version is `1.5.0`, the bugfix branch would be `hotfix/1.5.1`. All pull requests for bug fixes should be on a `hotfix` branch, unless the bug fix depends on a new feature.

The `master` branch should always have the latest stable version. When bugfix or minor releases are needed, the develop/hotfix branch will be merged into master and released.
