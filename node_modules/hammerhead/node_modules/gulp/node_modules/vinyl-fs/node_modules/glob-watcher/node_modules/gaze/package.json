Does not\n  recurse directories.\n* `watched()` Returns the currently watched files.\n* `relative([dir, unixify])` Returns the currently watched files with relative paths.\n  * `dir` {string} Only return relative files for this directory.\n  * `unixify` {boolean} Return paths with `/` instead of `\\\\` if on Windows.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Why Another `fs.watch` Wrapper?\nI liked parts of other `fs.watch` wrappers but none had all the features I\nneeded. This lib combines the features I needed from other fine watch libs:\nSpeedy data behavior from\n[paulmillr's chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar), API interface\nfrom [mikeal's watch](https://github.com/mikeal/watch) and file globbing using\n[isaacs's glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) which is also used by\n[cowboy's Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt).\n\n### How do I fix the error `EMFILE: Too many opened files.`?\nThis is because of your system's max opened file limit. For OSX the default is\nvery low (256). Increase your limit temporarily with `ulimit -n 10480`, the\nnumber being the new max limit.\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.\nAdd unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code\nusing [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n* 0.5.1 - Use setImmediate (process.nextTick for node v0.8) to defer ready/nomatch events (@amasad).\n* 0.5.0 - Process is now kept alive while watching files.
