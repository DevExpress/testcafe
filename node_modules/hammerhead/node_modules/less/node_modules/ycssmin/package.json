  "readme": "CSSMin\n======\n\nThis project is a fork of [jbleuzen/node-cssmin](https://github.com/jbleuzen/node-cssmin).\n\nIt was originally based on the javascript for of the css minification tool used inside of \n[YUICompressor](https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor) based on code from Stoyan Stefanov and Isaac Schlueter.\n\nWe forked this project in order to maintain and up keep it on a regular basis.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can either download the plugin and unzip it into to your project folder or you can use npm to install the `ycssmin` package.\n\n`npm -g i ycssmin`\n\nBuild Status\n------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yui/ycssmin.png)](http://travis-ci.org/yui/ycssmin)\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nClone this repo:\n\n`npm test`\n\nCode Coverage\n-------------\n\nWe are using [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) to provide code coverage, to view the report:\n\n`npm test`\n\nThen open `./coverage/lcov-report`\n\nWe also publish the [latest here](http://yui.github.com/ycssmin/).\n\nWe ask that all patches have a test attached and full coverage.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe module exports the cssmin function, so you can use it with: \n\n`var cssmin = require('ycssmin').cssmin;`\n\nThe function cssmin takes two arguments:\n* `input` : the CSS content you want to minimize.\n* `linebreakpos` : the number of characters before the end of the line. If empty, the output will have only one line.\n\t\nExample :\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs'),\n    cssmin = require('ycssmin').cssmin,\n    css = fs.readFileSync(\"/Any/Random/CSS/File.css\", encoding='utf8'),\n    min = cssmin(css);\n\nconsole.log(min);\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n    Copyright 2012 Yahoo!
