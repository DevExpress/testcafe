# Expectations

If we do not respond promptly, we ask that you give us the benefit of the
doubt, as it is possible the email went to spam or we have been so focused on
something else we haven't seen it yet. Please send us a quick message,
*without detail* to one of the following:

* An issue here on GitHub, with an email address we can use to contact you
  for a more detailed report.
* Message [@newrelic](https://twitter.com/newrelic) on Twitter.
* Give our engineering team a heads up on IRC in #newrelic on Freenode.
