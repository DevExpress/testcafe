# Guidelines for contributing code

New Relic welcomes code contributions by the Node community to this module, and
have taken effort to make this process easy for both contributors and our
development team.

When contributing, keep in mind that New Relic customers (that's you!) are
running many different versions of Node, some of them pretty old (most of you
have moved off 0.6, but there are more than a few 0.8 applications still out
there). Changes that depend on the newest version of Node will probably be
rejected, with prejudice if they replace something backwards compatible.

## And finally...

You are welcome to send pull requests to us - however, by doing so you agree
that you are granting New Relic a non-exclusive, non-revokable, no-cost license
to use the code, algorithms, patents, and ideas in that code in our products if
we so choose. You also agree the code is provided as-is and you provide no
warranties as to its fitness or correctness for any purpose.
